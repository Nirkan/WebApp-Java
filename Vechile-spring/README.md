### This is an example based on telusko channel.

- Here we use maven mvnrepository for spring context dependencies and paste it on pom.xml file.

- We create a main App.java.

- Then we create a different classes e.g. vechile.java, Car.java, Bike.java, Tyre.java

- We then create spring.xml file used for configuration.

- Optionally annotation based configurations are also used here.

- @component @Override @Autowire are used for configuration as an option to xml based configuration.

- All the different files are attached in this folder.
